# DataHelix

### An open source project supported by [Scott Logic](https://www.scottlogic.com/)
The generation of representative test and simulation data is challenging and time-consuming. The DataHelix generator (referred to as 'the generator') allows you to quickly create data, based on a schema, using a variety of generation modes for the purpose of testing and validation.

You can use the generator to commission and maintain your test systems with data that conforms to your live environments without copying data or breaching GDPR.

The generator has been written in Java to allow cross platform compatibility, allowing it to work on Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac and Linux equally.

## Getting started
You will need Java v1.8 installed to run the generator, it can be [downloaded here](https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp).

You can download the generator from the [GitHub project releases page](https://github.com/ScottLogic/datahelix/releases/).

For a guide on how the generator may be used see the [step by step instructions](./docs/GettingStarted/StepByStepInstructions.md).

<!-- A few motivating and useful examples of how your project can be used. Spice this up with code blocks and potentially screenshots / videos ([LiceCap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) is great for this kind of thing) -->

## Generate Data
`java -jar generator.jar generate "<path to profile>" "<path to output directory or file>"`

Optional additional switches:
* `--violate` generate data which violates the profile constraints
* `-n 1000` limit the output to 1000 rows
* `-t <data-generation-type>` - produce different data in different ways, see [generation types](./generator/docs/GenerationTypes.md)

See [additional details here](./docs/Options/GenerateOptions.md) on the full list of switches that can be provided.

## How it works

There are 2 discrete primary elements:

| Product | Description | Status | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Profile | A representation of the data schema and rules which can be used to generate data | Stable | |
| Generator | A tool for generating data from a given profile | Stable - beta | Supports data generation and generation of data that has been [delibrately violated](./generator/docs/DeliberateViolation.md). |

See [overview](./docs/Profiles.md) and [schema](./docs/Schema.md) for details about profiles and how they work.

### Development setup

This product requires **Java version 1.8** to be installed. Later versions are not supported at present.
* Follow the steps in the [setup instructions](./generator/docs/GeneratorSetup.md) then continue with these steps.
* Build the solution using your preferred method - the project is fully compatible with IntelliJ and Eclipse. 
You can use Maven if you prefer by executing the following command in the project root directory:
    ```bash
    mvn install
    ```
* Run the generator - see the [examples here](./generator/README.md).
* To generate a project documentation website run the 
[maven site](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-site.html) command. 
The website will contain information about the projects such as libraries used and unit test report.
Once generated the website can be found at `target\site\index.html` in each of the project directories.
    ```bash
    mvn site
    ```
